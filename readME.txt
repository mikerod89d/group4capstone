So I'm still debating whether or not to use a popup or a new page for submitting and replying to tickets.

Option1: Table with submission buttons that open a popup for editing/replying. (would be cooler looking, but probably harder to code)
Option2: Table with check boxes and a submit button at the bottom that leads to new page. (Probably easier)
